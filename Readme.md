# Generating adversarial images in the browser with tensorflow.js

_Live demo + full code listing + some background on memory management
and asynchronous execution in tensorflow.js. (April 2021)_

This repository hosts my article on adversarial image generation
with tensorflow.js, available at https://krasch.io/adversarial-tensorflowjs/.

The repository contains the article text itself (in the root folder) 
as well as the source code for the live demo (in the folder demo).

The source code for the demo I am placing under MIT license. The
article itself has no license, i.e. all rights remain with me.
